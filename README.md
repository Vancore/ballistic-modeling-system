📌 Project OverviewBMS is a specialized computational tool for simulating projectile motion with extreme precision. It bridges the gap between simple school physics and real-world ballistics by implementing complex atmospheric drag calculations.🚀 Key CapabilitiesDual-Core Simulation: Switch instantly between an ideal vacuum environment and a realistic atmospheric model.Drag Equation Integration: Uses the Euler method for numerical integration, factoring in air density ($\rho$), drag coefficient ($C_x$), and cross-sectional area.Real-Time Computation: Adaptive calculation engine that updates telemetry and visuals the moment a parameter is changed.Telemetry Dashboard: Comprehensive data logging of time-stamped coordinates and velocity vectors for deep-dive analysis.🧮 Physical LogicThe system handles the complex interaction of forces:Gravity: Constant downward acceleration ($g$).Aerodynamic Drag: A velocity-dependent force $F = \frac{1}{2} C_w \rho S v^2$ that acts opposite to the motion vector, creating realistic "curved" trajectories.🛠 Tech StackCore Logic: Python 3 (Math & Physics)Interface: Streamlit FrameworkData Handling: PandasVisualization: Plotly Engine
